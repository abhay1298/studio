# Robot Maestro - Python Execution Backend

This directory contains a Python Flask server that acts as the **real execution backend** for the Robot Maestro UI.

## What It Does

This server exposes several endpoints:
- `/run`: The Next.js frontend calls this to trigger a test execution. It receives the test configuration (e.g., tags, suite names), constructs the appropriate `robot` command, executes it using Python's `subprocess` module, and returns the real logs and status to the UI.
- `/list-suites`: This endpoint scans the configured test directory, finds all `.robot` files, and returns a structured list of test suites and their individual test cases to the UI's Project Explorer.
- `/reports`: Manages access to the archived HTML reports and logs generated by Robot Framework.
- `/stop`: Allows the UI to request termination of a currently running test execution.

## How to Run It

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Python 3.6+
    *   pip

2.  **Installation**:
    Navigate to this directory in your terminal and install the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configuration**:
    *   Open the `server.py` file in a text editor.
    *   Find the line `TESTS_DIRECTORY = ...`.
    *   **You must change this path** to the absolute path of your Robot Framework project folder (the folder containing your `.robot` files).

4.  **Running the Server**:
    Use the following command to start the development server:
    ```sh
    flask --app server run --port=5001
    ```
    Alternatively, you can run the Python script directly:
     ```sh
    python server.py
    ```

    The server will now be running and listening for requests on `http://localhost:5001`. The Robot Maestro UI is already configured to send requests to this address.
